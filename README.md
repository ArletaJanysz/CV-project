I am a communicative person, ready to work in a team and open to new professional experiences. My determination and enthusiasm for work allow me to work effectively in a dynamic environment. I learn quickly and like new challenges. Both in my daily life and in the work, I highly value well-organized workspaces and time management. The order, which I believe is the base for effective work, helps me to fully focus and work with the necessary calmness, as well as maintain clean code.
